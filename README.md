## Key Points

* Apple makes some of the nicest laptops available but couples them with an OS that is very hard to customize. It would be nice if we could have a MacBook running macOS along with a Linux distro. With newer laptops that have the [T1/T2 security chip](https://threatpost.com/apple-modernizes-its-hardware-security-with-t2/138904/), it becomes almost impossible to efficiently run Linux. The battery performance is sub-par and there can be infrequent crashes every now and then.

* [**Overview of the current state of support for Linux on mac.**](https://github.com/Dunedan/mbp-2016-linux)

* With recent kernel upgrades, the MacBooks without the TouchBar now have complete support in the Linux kernel. This makes the [MacBook Air 7,2](https://igotoffer.com/apple/macbook-air-7-2) a unique machine. It's old enough that it is now well supported.
* Kali Linux has introduced significant changes going into 2020. The default root user nature of previous versions of Kali made it unsuitable for daily use. [They have introduced a new theme based on Gnome, and most importantly the default user is no longer root.](https://www.kali.org/news/kali-default-non-root-user/)
* Kali in live mode will be running as *user* **kali** *password* **kali**. No more **root**/**toor**.
* Another interesting thing of note is that the default kernel has no out of the box support for Wi-Fi which requires the [broadcom driver](https://packages.debian.org/buster/broadcom-sta-common), so **it's best if the MacBook can be connected to the internet via USB tethering or USB to Ehernet before installation begins**.
