# KaliBook 

Some notes on setting up [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/) on an old [Macbook Air 2015](https://everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook-air/specs/macbook-air-core-i7-2.2-13-early-2015-specs.html).

## Key Points

* Apple makes some of the nicest laptops available but couples them with an OS that is very hard to customize. It would be nice if we could have a MacBook running macOS along with a Linux distro. With newer laptops that have the T1/T2 security chip, it becomes almost impossible to efficiently run Linux. The battery performance is sub-par and there can be infrequent crashes every now and then.

* [**Overview of the current state of support for Linux on mac.**](https://github.com/Dunedan/mbp-2016-linux)

* With recent kernel upgrades, the MacBooks without the touchbar now have complete support in the linux kernel. This makes the [MacBook Air 7,2](https://igotoffer.com/apple/macbook-air-7-2) a unique machine. It's old enough that it is now well supported.
* Recently something really big happened in the world of penetration testing. KaliOS has apparently decided to go a bit more mainstream. [They have also introduced a new theme based on Gnome, and most imprtantly the default user is no longer root.](https://www.kali.org/news/kali-default-non-root-user/)
* Another interesting thing of note is that the default kernel has no out of the box support for wifi which requires the [broadcom driver](https://packages.debian.org/jessie/all/broadcom-sta-common/download), so it's best if the MacBook can be connected to the internet via USB tethering or USB to Ehernet before installation begins.
